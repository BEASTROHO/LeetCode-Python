## 🧮 Problem: Two Sum

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Source**: [LeetCode #1](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

---

### 📝 Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

---

### 📘 Examples


Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6  
Output: [0,1]


---

### 📌 Constraints

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴  
- -10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹  
- -10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹  
- Only one valid answer exists.
